# My APL Quest

This repo just documents my attempts at solving [APL Quest](https://apl.quest/) problems, so I can keep track of my progress with learning Dyalog APL (just for fun).

*These are NOT reference solutions!* My early attempts are very verbose, unidiomatic and sometimes dumb; I just went with my gut and try not to invest too much time into thinking about the problem. Afterwards, I watch the (very good) solutions videos on the website and take some notes on things that I have learned.
